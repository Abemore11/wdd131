    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of the Software Portfolio is to highlight a selection of projects that demonstrate my technical
      abilities as a programmer. It will provide clear and professional insight into the tools, technologies, and
      approaches I've worked with so far.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience for this portfolio includes hiring managers, recruiters, and engineering teams who may evaluate my
      skills and potential. It also serves anyone looking for a concise and professional view of my work,
      problem-solving style, and technical capabilities.</p>

    <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
    <p>This site will use JavaScript to generate dynamic HTML from a dedicated JSON file that will contain project
      objects. Each object will hold the details for a specific project. This approach will allow the portfolio to
      automatically display updated content without requiring manual edits to the page.</p>

    <h2>Branding</h2>
    <h3>Website Logo</h3>
    <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

    <h2>Style Guide</h2>

    <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Color Palette</h3>
    <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

    <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
    Palette URL:
    <a href="https://coolors.co/f5f5f5-e4e4e4-1a2a37-c15a2a"
      target="_blank">https://coolors.co/f5f5f5-e4e4e4-1a2a37-c15a2a</a>

    <table class="colors">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">f5f5f5</td>
          <td class="secondary">e4e4e4</td>
          <td class="accent1">1a2a37</td>
          <td class="accent2">c15a2a</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Typography</h3>
    <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

    <h4>
      Heading Font: TikTok Sans
    </h4>
    <h4>
      Paragraph Font: Inter
    </h4>

    </p>

    <!-- ------------------------Step 10------------------------------ -->

    <h3>Navigation</h3>
    <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

    <h2>Content</h2>
    <h3>Home page</h3>
    <p>Something Like:</p>
    <p>I’m a software developer who loves building tools, solving problems, and creating intuitive applications. I
      approach development like craftsmanship—combining technical skill with creativity to build software that is clean,
      scalable, and meaningful.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m skilled in Python, C#, JavaScript, and SQL, and I’m currently studying machine learning, data analysis, and
      backend engineering. I enjoy learning new technologies, designing useful tools, and building applications that
      help people.
    </p>
    <p>
      My contact info and current picture will be shared when the page is ready.
    </p>

    <h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
    <p>
      Project titles such as: Weather Dashboard, Data Analysis with Python, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      Project descriptions such as: A dashboard that visualizes data using charts and tables. Built with Python and JavaScript to demonstrate full-stack integration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Images will be generated using Ai and will be specific to each project.
    </p>
    

    <h2>Wireframes</h2>
    <p>
      Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
      here
    </p>

    <h3>Home</h3>
    <p>
      The Home page is meant to be minimal - to only hold important and succinct info. This makes the 'Portfolio' link
      more pronounced.
    </p>
    <img src="images/about-page.png" alt="home page wireframe" />

    <h3>Portfolio Page</h3>
    <p>
      The sections that will hold project info will be populated using JavaScript (dynamic HTML). There will be more
      than 2 - I only included 2 sections in the wireframe for simplicity - but this is meant to to scale with time.
